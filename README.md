**This project is still under development.**

![WIP](https://i.imgur.com/cnjBAcJ.png)

Mobile game made in Unity3D. Steer a platform with a ball on it up into the right hole while avoiding the other holes. Use either touch screen buttons or swiping motions to move the platform. Collect as many points as you can. <br> Includes two modes: Ladder and Free. Ladder mode starts off on an easy level and then gradually takes you to the next and more difficult levels based on the higher score you have. <br> Free mode lets you freely wander on any level; the higher you get the more points you get.
